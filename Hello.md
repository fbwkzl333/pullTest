Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years

You'd like to meet, to go over everything

They say that time's supposed to heal ya

But I ain't done much healing


Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times to tell you

I'm sorry, for everything that I've done

But when I call you never seem to be home
